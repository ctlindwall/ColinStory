Once upon a time, there was a turtle named Patrick. He was the fastest turtle in the history of the world.

Therefore he signed up for a race to prove that he could run faster than a rabbit. But in the evening before the race started, it bagan to rain heavily. Patrick were worried.

However, due to the faith in the turtle tribe. Turtle never give up. So he decided he is going to the race no matter what happens. In the worst case, he can still swim like the old school turtle. 

But all of a sudden, Bear grylls appears. He looked at the Partick and said "the turtles have high proteins and vitamins"... Sad story indeed.

Patrick the turtle ran so fast that not even Bear grylls could catch him. The next day it rained so hard, that he had to swim against the rabbit, and he won!
